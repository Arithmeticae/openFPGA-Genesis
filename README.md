# Genesis for Analogue Pocket

This is a port of a mister port of the [fpgagen](https://github.com/Torlus/fpgagen) core for Analogue Pocket.
I am sure I am forgetting something else here... I know some JT and Kitrinx modules are used. So, shout out to them.

## Important to read this first!
- This core is far from complete and I am aware of most issues.
- You *can* report issues, but I probably won't look at them.
- No PAL.
- No proper region detection (or switching).
- Due to above, US only currently.
- Plenty of games do not work correctly.
- No save states work.
- Probably other broken things... I have noticed bin ROMs tend to work okay.
- Many missing core settings.
